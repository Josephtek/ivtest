# Main test script
#
####################

There are a group of tests that are meant to exercise the compiler
and the run time. To run them just type:

./regress

or

perl vvp_reg.pl

or if perl is located in /usr/bin

./vvp_reg.pl

The output from these tests are displayed on the screen
and are also placed in the regression_report.txt file.
The expected output for V0.9.devel is located in the
regression_report-devel.txt file. The expected output
for V0.8.? is located in regression_report-v0.8.txt.

The results from individual tests can be found in the
log directory and gold files, when needed, are in the
gold directory. The source files can be found in the
ivltests and contrib directories. The list of tests
and how they are run is in the regress.list file.


####################
#
# VPI test script
#
####################

To test the VPI interface type:

perl vpi_reg.pl

or if perl is located in /usr/bin

./vpi_reg.pl

All these tests should pass for V0.9.devel. V0.8.? is
expected to fail for realtime (64 bit time issue) and
memmon (no full array call backs).

The individual test results are found in the vpi_log
directory and the gold files are in the vpi_gold
directory. The source files are in the vpi directory.
The vpi_regress.list file has the tests to perform.


####################
#
# VHDL test script
#
####################

This test script require that ghdl be installed in your
path and is used to test the Verilog to VHDL translation.

perl vhdl_reg.pl

or if perl is located in /usr/bin

./vhdl_reg.pl

The expected output for V0.9.devel is located in the
vhdl_regression_report-devel.txt file. V0.8 does not
support converting Verilog to VHDL.

# MinGW test issues
#
####################

Running under MinGW (3.14+ runtime) the following tests are
expected to fail:

pr1699519  - MinGW has three digit exponents.
pr1703120  - integer infinity and infinity display
pr1752823a  - missing -0
pr1752823b  - infinity display and missing -0
swrite  - MinGW has three digit exponents
pr1864115  - %#g of 0.0 gives six decimal digits
ca_mult  - %#g of 0.0 gives six decimal digits
pr1873372  - MinGW has three digit exponents
test_va_math  - infinity and NaN display, missing -0
test_vams_math  - infinity and NaN display, missing -0
ca_time  - %#g of 0.0 gives six decimal digits

pr723  - MinGW has some fd problems that need to be investigated.

All of these issues produce something that humans should recognize
as correct results (-0 == 0, extra digits, out of order text, etc.).
